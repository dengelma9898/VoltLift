# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables users to fine-tune individual workout plans by customizing exercises with detailed parameters including repetitions, weight, and repetition types (warming up, normal, cooling down). Users can modify existing workout plans to match their specific training needs and progression levels, creating personalized workout experiences within the VoltLift app.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a fitness user, I want to edit exercises within my workout plans, so that I can customize the training parameters to match my current fitness level and goals.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a workout plan THEN the system SHALL display all exercises in that plan with their current parameters
2. WHEN a user taps on an exercise in a plan THEN the system SHALL open an exercise editing interface
3. WHEN a user modifies exercise parameters THEN the system SHALL validate the input values for safety and reasonableness
4. WHEN a user saves exercise modifications THEN the system SHALL persist the changes to the workout plan
5. IF a user cancels exercise editing THEN the system SHALL discard unsaved changes and return to the plan view

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a fitness user, I want to set different repetition types for each exercise set, so that I can structure my workouts with proper warm-up, working sets, and cool-down phases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user edits an exercise THEN the system SHALL provide options to set repetition types including "warming up", "normal", and "cooling down"
2. WHEN a user adds a new set to an exercise THEN the system SHALL allow selection of the repetition type for that set
3. WHEN a user views an exercise during workout execution THEN the system SHALL clearly display the repetition type for each set
4. WHEN a user completes a set THEN the system SHALL track completion status by repetition type
5. IF a user removes a set THEN the system SHALL update the exercise structure accordingly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a fitness user, I want to adjust weight and repetition parameters for each exercise set, so that I can progressively overload and track my strength improvements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user edits an exercise set THEN the system SHALL allow modification of weight values with appropriate units (kg/lbs)
2. WHEN a user edits an exercise set THEN the system SHALL allow modification of repetition count with validation for reasonable ranges
3. WHEN a user enters weight values THEN the system SHALL validate inputs are positive numbers within safe training ranges
4. WHEN a user enters repetition values THEN the system SHALL validate inputs are positive integers within reasonable training ranges (1-50)
5. IF a user enters invalid parameters THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages and prevent saving

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a fitness user, I want to add or remove sets from exercises in my workout plans, so that I can adjust training volume based on my current capacity and goals.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user edits an exercise THEN the system SHALL provide options to add new sets to the exercise
2. WHEN a user adds a set THEN the system SHALL initialize it with default values based on existing sets or exercise defaults
3. WHEN a user wants to remove a set THEN the system SHALL provide a clear deletion mechanism with confirmation
4. WHEN a user removes a set THEN the system SHALL update set numbering and maintain exercise structure integrity
5. IF an exercise has only one set THEN the system SHALL prevent deletion of that set to maintain exercise validity

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a fitness user, I want my customized workout plans to be saved and synchronized with HealthKit, so that my personalized training data is preserved and integrated with my health records.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user saves workout plan modifications THEN the system SHALL persist changes to Core Data immediately
2. WHEN a user completes a customized workout THEN the system SHALL sync the detailed exercise data to HealthKit
3. WHEN a user accesses a previously customized plan THEN the system SHALL load all saved parameters accurately
4. WHEN the system syncs to HealthKit THEN it SHALL include repetition type metadata in the workout data
5. IF synchronization fails THEN the system SHALL maintain local data integrity and retry sync operations

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a fitness user, I want to see a clear overview of my customized workout plan before starting, so that I can review my planned training session and make any final adjustments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views a workout plan THEN the system SHALL display a summary of all exercises with their customized parameters
2. WHEN a user views exercise details in the plan overview THEN the system SHALL show set count, weights, reps, and repetition types
3. WHEN a user starts a workout from a customized plan THEN the system SHALL guide them through each set with the specified parameters
4. WHEN a user is in workout execution mode THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate current set type (warm-up, normal, cool-down)
5. IF a user wants to modify parameters during workout THEN the system SHALL allow quick adjustments without losing progress
