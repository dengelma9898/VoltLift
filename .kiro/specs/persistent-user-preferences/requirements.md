# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables VoltLift to persist user equipment selections and workout plans locally on the device, eliminating the need for users to reconfigure their setup every time they restart the app. The system will save equipment preferences and generated workout plans to Core Data, providing a seamless user experience that maintains continuity across app sessions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a VoltLift user, I want my selected equipment to be remembered across app sessions, so that I don't have to reconfigure my available equipment every time I open the app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects equipment during initial setup THEN the system SHALL persist the equipment selection to local storage
2. WHEN a user modifies their equipment selection THEN the system SHALL update the persisted equipment data
3. WHEN a user reopens the app THEN the system SHALL automatically load their previously selected equipment
4. WHEN no equipment selection exists THEN the system SHALL present the equipment selection flow
5. IF equipment data becomes corrupted THEN the system SHALL gracefully fallback to the equipment selection flow

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a VoltLift user, I want my generated workout plans to be saved automatically, so that I can access and reuse them without regenerating them each time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a workout plan is generated THEN the system SHALL automatically save the plan to local storage
2. WHEN a user creates multiple workout plans THEN the system SHALL maintain a collection of all saved plans
3. WHEN a user reopens the app THEN the system SHALL display their saved workout plans for selection
4. WHEN a user selects a saved workout plan THEN the system SHALL load the complete plan with all exercises and configurations
5. IF a saved plan becomes corrupted THEN the system SHALL remove the corrupted plan and continue with remaining valid plans

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a VoltLift user, I want to manage my saved workout plans, so that I can organize, rename, or delete plans that are no longer needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing saved workout plans THEN the system SHALL display plan names, creation dates, and exercise counts
2. WHEN a user long-presses on a saved plan THEN the system SHALL present options to rename or delete the plan
3. WHEN a user renames a plan THEN the system SHALL update the plan name and persist the change
4. WHEN a user deletes a plan THEN the system SHALL remove the plan from storage and update the UI
5. WHEN a user attempts to delete their last remaining plan THEN the system SHALL warn about losing all saved plans

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a VoltLift user, I want my equipment and plan data to be stored securely on my device, so that my fitness preferences remain private and accessible offline.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing user preferences THEN the system SHALL use Core Data for local persistence
2. WHEN accessing stored data THEN the system SHALL ensure data is available offline
3. WHEN the app is deleted THEN the system SHALL ensure all user data is removed from the device
4. WHEN data is accessed THEN the system SHALL validate data integrity before use
5. IF data validation fails THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully and provide user feedback
